eslint-config-ultraq
====================

ESLint config for all of my JavaScript projects.

Like other developers out there, I got tired of copy/pasting my ESLint settings
between projects - updating them for the current thing I'm working on,
forgetting to port them back to previous projects, etc - so it's about time I
created a shareable ESLint config so I can put this little annoyance to bed.

Made to be used in conjunction with the `eslint:recommended` config, and only
specifies `rules` as it can't make assumptions of the environment or parser for
each project.
